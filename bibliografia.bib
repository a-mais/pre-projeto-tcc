   abstract = {Planning an itinerary is a complex activity, which includes the choice of a few places to see, coupled with information on timing, transferring methods and related activities. Intelligent tools such as recommender systems have been used in order to support these activities. While decisions regarding the type of trip to undertake are strongly influenced by tourists' personalities, currently only a few recommenders exploit information about this aspect. Our aim is to provide itinerary recommender system designers with some guidance on the integration of knowledge on personality traits and itinerary factors in a recommender. To do so, first we modeled the most important aspects of an itinerary, starting from the state-of-the-art literature on recommender systems for tourism. We identified thirteen factors, from the variety (in type and topic) of Points-of-Interest (POIs) to the expected duration of transfer times, grouped into three broader dimensions (POIs, time and choice modality). Then, we carried out a survey-based study on Generation Z (namely, the generation of people born between 1996/1997 and 2012) to investigate if the Big Five personality traits can affect the user's decision-making process when planning an itinerary, and, in particular if they are related to user preferences for the itinerary factors in our model. Finally, we used our findings to define some guidelines for the design of advanced itinerary recommender systems.},

    abstract = {Collaborative filtering (CF), one of the most successful recommendation approaches, continues to attract interest in both academia and industry. However, one key issue limiting the success of collaborative filtering in certain application domains is the cold-start problem, a situation where historical data is too sparse (known as the sparsity problem), new users have not rated enough items (known as the new user problem), or both. In this paper, we aim at addressing the cold-start problem by incorporating human personality into the collaborative filtering framework. We propose three approaches: the first is a recommendation method based on users' personality information alone; the second is based on a linear combination of both personality and rating information; and the third uses a cascade mechanism to leverage both resources. To evaluate their effectiveness, we have conducted an experimental study comparing the proposed approaches with the traditional rating-based CF in two cold-start scenarios: sparse data sets and new users. Our results show that the proposed CF variations, which consider personality characteristics, can significantly improve the performance of the traditional rating-based CF in terms of the evaluation metrics MAE and ROC sensitivity.},

For this reason it is particularly important to design new similarity metrics which provide greater precision in the results offered to users who have cast few votes. This paper presents a new similarity measure perfected using optimization based on neural learning, which exceeds the best results obtained with current metrics. The metric has been tested on the Netflix and Movielens databases, obtaining important improvements in the measures of accuracy, precision and recall when applied to new user cold start situations. The paper includes the mathematical formalization describing how to obtain the main quality measures of a recommender system using leave-one-out cross validation.},

Color quantization is essentially a large-scale combinatorial optimization problem. Many clustering algorithms, both of hierarchical and partitional types, have been applied to this problem since the 1980s. In general, hierarchical color quantization algorithms are faster, whereas partitional ones produce better results provided that they are initialized properly. In this paper, we propose a novel partitional color quantization algorithm based on a binary splitting formulation of MacQueen’s online k-means algorithm. Unlike MacQueen’s original algorithm, the proposed algorithm is both deterministic and free of initialization. Experiments on a diverse set of public test images demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is significantly faster than two popular batch k-means algorithms while yielding nearly identical results. In other words, unlike previously proposed k-means variants, our algorithm addresses both the initialization and acceleration issues of k-means without sacrificing the simplicity of the algorithm. The presented algorithm may be of independent interest as a general-purpose clustering algorithm.},

   abstract = {The complexity associated with groups of tourists led to the emergence of Group Recommender Systems (GRS) for tourism. But if generating recommendations for small groups is a complex task, to provide them to large and occasional groups is even more. This complexity is especially due to the group's heterogeinity, conflicting preferences, the information overload found on the internet and the tourists’ different ways of coping with the information, hindering the recommendation process from the users’ profile construction to the final recommendation of a list of points of interest to visit. In this work, we show how we tackled the identified issues in a GRS prototype, Grouplanner, including the cold-start problem, by predicting the tourists’ preferences based only on their personality and dividing the main group into subgroups of similar personality; by using a Multi-Agent Microservice; a novel dynamic clustering algorithm, d-means, adapted from the k-means algorithm, that does not need to know the number of clusters a priori; and association rules. Using a personality dataset of n=100k users, the proposed d-means algorithm was tested against two baselines (k-means and k-means++), showing better results in the clustering quality and scalability. We were also able to determine a large set of association rules to refine the recommendations, although further improvements are needed. To test the Grouplanner prototype, a simulation with real users (n=35) was conducted. The results showed the subgroups formed were very compact, revealing a very good clustering quality, with an average silhouette of s = 0.91. 11 of the 15 proposed tourist preferences were successfully predicted and used for the preliminary recommendation lists, being 92\% of the participants satisfied with the individual recommendations and 96\% with the group recommendations.},

The present research develops two abbreviated forms of the BFI-2—the 30-item BFI-2-S and the 15-item BFI-2-XS—and then examines their measurement properties. At the level of the Big Five domains, we find that the BFI-2-S and BFI-2-XS retain much of the full measure's reliability and validity. At the facet level, we find that the BFI-2-S may be useful for examining facet traits in reasonably large samples, whereas the BFI-2-XS should not be used to assess facets. Finally, we discuss some key tradeoffs to consider when deciding whether to administer an abbreviated form instead of the full BFI-2.},

Study 1 specified a hierarchical model of personality structure with 15 facet traits nested within the Big Five domains, and developed a preliminary item pool to measure this structure. Study 2 used conceptual and empirical criteria to construct the BFI-2 domain and facet scales from the preliminary item pool. Study 3 used data from 2 validation samples to evaluate the BFI-2's measurement properties and substantive relations with self-reported and peer-reported criteria. The results of these studies indicate that the BFI-2 is a reliable and valid personality measure, and an important advance over the original BFI. Specifically, the BFI-2 introduces a robust hierarchical structure, controls for individual differences in acquiescent responding, and provides greater bandwidth, fidelity, and predictive power than the original BFI, while still retaining the original measure's conceptual focus, brevity, and ease of understanding. The BFI-2 therefore offers valuable new opportunities for research examining the structure, assessment, development, and life outcomes of personality traits.},

    abstract = {Organizing data into sensible groupings is one of the most fundamental modes of understanding and learning. As an example, a common scheme of scientific classification puts organisms into a system of ranked taxa: domain, kingdom, phylum, class, etc. Cluster analysis is the formal study of methods and algorithms for grouping, or clustering, objects according to measured or perceived intrinsic characteristics or similarity. Cluster analysis does not use category labels that tag objects with prior identifiers, i.e., class labels. The absence of category information distinguishes data clustering (unsupervised learning) from classification or discriminant analysis (supervised learning). The aim of clustering is to find structure in data and is therefore exploratory in nature. Clustering has a long and rich history in a variety of scientific fields. One of the most popular and simple clustering algorithms, K-means, was first published in 1955. In spite of the fact that K-means was proposed over 50 years ago and thousands of clustering algorithms have been published since then, K-means is still widely used. This speaks to the difficulty in designing a general purpose clustering algorithm and the ill-posed problem of clustering. We provide a brief overview of clustering, summarize well known clustering methods, discuss the major challenges and key issues in designing clustering algorithms, and point out some of the emerging and useful research directions, including semi-supervised clustering, ensemble clustering, simultaneous feature selection during data clustering, and large scale data clustering.},

Unlike conventional recommendation systems, these new systems solve traditional problems such as the cold start and data sparsity problems. This survey aims to study and systematically classify personality-aware recommendation systems. To the best of our knowledge, this survey is the first that focuses on personality-aware recommendation systems. We explore the different design choices of personality-aware recommendation systems, by comparing their personality modeling methods, as well as their recommendation techniques. Furthermore, we present the commonly used datasets and point out some of the challenges of personality-aware recommendation systems.},

    abstract = {Ephemeral group recommendation (EGR) aims to suggest items for a group of users who come together for the first time. Existing work typically consider individual preferences as the sole factor in aggregating group preferences. However, they neglect to take into account the importance of the individual inherent factors, such as personality, and thus fail to accurately simulate the group decision-making process. Additionally, these methods often struggle due to insufficient interactive records. To tackle these issues, a Personality-Guided Preference Aggregator (PEGA) is proposed, which guides the preference aggregation of group members based on their personalities, rather than relying solely on their preferences. Specifically, implicit personalities are first extracted from user reviews. Hyper-rectangles are then used to aggregate individual personalities to obtain the “Group Personality”, which allows for the learning of personality distributions within the group. Subsequently, a personality attention mechanism is employed to aggregate group preferences, and a preference-based fine-tuning module is used to balance the weights of personality and preferences. The role of personality in this approach is twofold: (1) To estimate the importance of individual users in a group and provide explainability; (2) To alleviate the data sparsity issue encountered in ephemeral groups. Experimental results demonstrate that, on four real-world datasets, the PEGA model significantly outperforms related baseline models in terms of classification accuracy and interpretability. Moreover, empirical evidence supports the idea that personality plays a pivotal role in enhancing the performance of EGR tasks.}

    abstract = {This paper addresses the problems that must be considered if computers are going to treat their users as individuals with distinct personalities, goals, and so forth. It first outlines the issues, and then proposes stereotypes as a useful mechanism for building models of individual users on the basis of a small amount of information about them. In order to build user models quickly, a large amount of uncertain knowledge must be incorporated into the models. The issue of how to resolve the conflicts that will arise among such inferences is discussed. A system, Grundy, is described that builds models of its users, with the aid of stereotypes, and then exploits those models to guide it in its task, suggesting novels that people may find interesting. If stereotypes are to be useful to Grundy, they must accurately characterize the users of the system. Some techniques to modify stereotypes on the basis of experience are discussed. An analysis of Grundy's performance shows that its user models are effective in guiding its performance.}

    abstract = {To provide recommendations to groups of tourists is a very complex task, especially due to conflicting preferences and the group’s heterogeneity. The introduction of Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) can be the leverage we are looking for. Their autonomy, isolated state, distribution, and loose coupling make them suitable for the development of distributed systems, being the concept similar to a Microservices architecture. This connection brought a new approach, the Multi-Agent Microservices (MAMS) architecture, which exposes agents as resources through REST endpoints, changing the way MAS are seen and implemented, facilitating the user ↔ agent interaction, with a more efficient interoperability, bringing faster and more intelligent systems. In this demonstration, we propose the use of a MAMS architecture to represent the tourists in a mobile Group Recommender System for Tourism prototype, Grouplanner, exposing their agents and knowledge as resources that can be consumed by HTTP clients by directly communicating with the tourists’ agents using REST endpoints, in order to provide faster and better recommendations.},
